# Actionable Agile Tools <https://www.infoq.com/articles/actionable-agile-tools>

Key takeaways
- Make your morning meetings not boring and more effective;
- Help your team keep on top of what really matters to them;
- Help your team get started right with Kanban;
- Stop putting off knowledge sharing until tomorrow;
- Motivate to your organisation why knowledge sharing needs to be invested in.

1. Morning Meetings
Nothing useful shared.

2. WIP Protocol
A protocol could be added to the explicit policy, but would it be explicit or is better to leave implicit? I rather leave it implicit.

3. Sick Days
Elect someone in your team to be "sick" for a day. This means that this person will not be bothered unless something of utterly importance come to happen.
