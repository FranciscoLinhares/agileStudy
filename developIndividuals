  - The main four things when selecting people:
    * Motivation (outcomes, customer value and a big vision) - If money was no objective, what would you do?
    * Support (mentoring, helping others, valuing teams) - When did you last help someone? When did someone last help you?
    * Customer (interested in customer, care about their pains) - What would you ask the customer? How would you measure their success?
    * Pride (proud of their work, care about their craft) - Describe something you are proud of; Describre something you are disappointed with;
  - The importance of Coaching
  You can fake until you make it, then you become it.
    
  
Questions
  - Can anyone be Agile?
No, to be Agile is a combination of personality traits and the context surroundings (the right environment that will foster the right personality traits to flourish). Eventhough, you live in an environment that promotes Agility, if your personalities is too much against the values and principles, you would never become truly Agile.
